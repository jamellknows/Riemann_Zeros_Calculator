# Riemann_Zeros_Calculator
This program works in three stages. 
1) Calculates the Riemann Zeta Function Non Trivial Zeros
2) Writes the zeros to a file. 
3) Plots the zeros on a graph. 
To run the program simply run it in your terminal. Then call it using riemann(number). 
If you do not enter a number the program automatically calculates 20 zeros. 
An example output for 998 is included with the file. 
the number of zeros is always your number + 1, so to calculate 2000 it is 998, 2*(number + 1).
